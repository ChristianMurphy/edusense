# EduSense: Practical Classroom Sensing at Scale

EduSense is a comprehensive sensing system that produces a plethora of
theoretically-motivated visual and audio features correlated with effective
instruction, which could feed professional development tools in much the same
way as a Fitbit sensor reports step count to an end user app.
Although previous systems have demonstrated some of our features in isolation,
EduSense is the first to unify them into a cohesive, real-time, in-the-wild
evaluated, and practically-deployable system.

Our [getting started](doc/getting_started.md) is a good starting point if you
are interested in building/developing/deploying EduSense.

## News

- *Oct 2019* We open-source our EduSense code!
- *Sep 2019* We presented our paper titled "Edusense: Practical Classroom Sensing at Scale" at Ubicomp'19.
